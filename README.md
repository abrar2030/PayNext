## Overview

PayNext is a comprehensive payment processing platform designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The system handles various payment methods, provides robust security features, and offers a seamless user experience for both merchants and customers.

## Architecture

PayNext follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

```
PayNext/
â”œâ”€â”€ API Gateway
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Routes requests to appropriate services
â”œâ”€â”€ Service Registry
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Manages service discovery
â”œâ”€â”€ Config Server
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Centralizes configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ Core Services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ User Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Payment Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Transaction Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Notification Service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Reporting Service
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend Applications
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Web Dashboard
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Mobile App
â””â”€â”€ Infrastructure
    â”œâ”€â”€ Database Cluster
    â”œâ”€â”€ Message Queue
    â”œâ”€â”€ Cache Layer

1. Client requests are received by the API Gateway
2. Gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices
3. Services communicate with each other via REST APIs or message queues
4. Service Registry maintains a registry of available services
5. Config Server provides centralized configuration management
