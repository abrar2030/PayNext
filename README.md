## Overview

PayNext is a comprehensive payment processing platform designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The system handles various payment methods, provides robust security features, and offers a seamless user experience for both merchants and customers.

## Architecture

PayNext follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

```
PayNext/
â”œâ”€â”€ API Gateway
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Routes requests to appropriate services
â”œâ”€â”€ Service Registry
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Manages service discovery
â”œâ”€â”€ Config Server
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Centralizes configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ Core Services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ User Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Payment Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Transaction Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Notification Service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Reporting Service
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend Applications
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Web Dashboard
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Mobile App
â””â”€â”€ Infrastructure
