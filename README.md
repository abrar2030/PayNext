## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture, consisting of:

- **Eureka Server**: Service registry for microservices.
- **API Gateway**: Routes external requests to appropriate microservices.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- **Payment Service**: Handles payment transactions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.
- **Frontend Application**: Built with React.js to provide a user interface.
- **MySQL Database**: Used for storing persistent data related to users and transactions.

The backend services communicate via REST APIs, and the microservices are registered with the Eureka Server for service discovery.

## Services

### Backend Services

- **Eureka Server** (`eureka-server`): Runs on port `8001`.
- **API Gateway** (`api-gateway`): Runs on port `8002`.
- **User Service** (`user-service`): Runs on port `8003`. Manages user registration, login, and user-related operations.
- **Payment Service** (`payment-service`): Runs on port `8004`. Manages payment initiation, processing, and history.
- **Notification Service** (`notification-service`): Runs on port `8005`. Handles notifications, such as payment confirmations.

### Frontend Application

- **React.js Application** (`frontend`): Runs on port `3000`. It provides the user interface for interacting with the backend services, allowing users to register, make payments, view payment history, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher installed.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- **Minikube** for local Kubernetes deployment.
- **kubectl** for managing Kubernetes clusters.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrar2030/PayNext.git
cd PayNext
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Set up the necessary environment variables for JWT secrets and Eureka server URLs in the backend services.

You can create a `.env` file or use Kubernetes secrets for deployment.

## Running the Application

### Docker Setup

Build and run all the microservices and the frontend using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy the application on Minikube using the provided Helm charts:

1. Start Minikube:

   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. Deploy using Helm:

   ```bash
   helm install paynext kubernetes
   ```

## Using the Application

Once the application is running, access the frontend using your browser:

- **Frontend URL**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### User Registration and Login
- Users can register by providing their details.
- Login with credentials to access the payment features.

### Payment Processing
- Initiate payments by filling in the required details.
- View payment history.

### Notifications
- Notifications are sent upon successful payment transactions.

## API Endpoints

### User Service
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login.

### Payment Service
- `POST /api/payments` - Initiate a new payment.
- `GET /api/payments/history` - Retrieve payment history.

### Notification Service
- `POST /api/notifications` - Send a notification.

## Testing
