# Backend Services for PayNext

## Overview

The backend directory contains the core microservices architecture that powers the PayNext fintech payment solution. This comprehensive backend system is built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, implementing a modern microservices approach to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The architecture follows industry best practices for distributed systems, with service discovery, API gateway patterns, and dedicated services for specific business domains.

## Architecture Components

The backend system is structured around several key microservices, each with a specific responsibility in the payment processing ecosystem. The Eureka Server provides service discovery capabilities, allowing services to locate and communicate with each other dynamically. The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, filtering, and cross-cutting concerns such as security and monitoring. The domain-specific services (User Service, Payment Service, Notification Service, and Fraud Detection Service) encapsulate the core business logic of the application.

Each service is containerized using Docker, making deployment consistent across different environments. The services communicate with each other using REST APIs, with the API Gateway handling the routing of requests to the appropriate service. This architecture allows for independent scaling of services based on demand and facilitates continuous deployment of individual components without affecting the entire system.

## Service Descriptions

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests to the backend services. It handles routing, load balancing, and security concerns such as authentication and authorization. Built using Spring Cloud Gateway, it leverages reactive programming principles for efficient request handling. The gateway implements JWT-based authentication to secure the APIs and includes routing configurations to direct traffic to the appropriate microservices.

### Eureka Server

The Eureka Server provides service discovery functionality, allowing microservices to register themselves and discover other services without hardcoded configurations. This enhances the system's resilience by enabling dynamic service location and facilitates scaling by allowing multiple instances of services to register themselves. The Eureka Server dashboard provides a visual representation of all registered services and their health status.

### User Service

The User Service manages user-related operations including registration, authentication, profile management, and user preferences. It has been enhanced with:
*   **Strong Password Policy:** User registration now enforces a robust password policy (8-20 characters, requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters) to improve security.
*   **Code Quality:** Refactored to use Lombok for reduced boilerplate code and includes improved error logging and handling for better maintainability.
*   **Security:** JWT handling has been hardened with specific exception logging for invalid, expired, or malformed tokens.

The service implements secure password handling, role-based access control, and integrates with the Payment Service for user transaction history. It uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions and includes comprehensive validation for user inputs.

### Payment Service

The Payment Service handles all payment processing operations, including transaction initiation, validation, processing, and recording. It implements secure payment protocols, integrates with external payment gateways, and maintains transaction records. The service includes fraud detection mechanisms and ensures compliance with financial regulations. It communicates with the Notification Service to alert users about transaction status changes.

### Fraud Detection Service (Renamed)

This service, formerly known as the "AI Fraud Detection Service," provides real-time transaction analysis and risk scoring. It is responsible for identifying and flagging suspicious activities before they can be processed. The service communicates with the Payment Service to provide a fraud risk assessment during the transaction lifecycle.

### Notification Service

The Notification Service manages all communication with users regarding account activities, transaction updates, and system notifications. It supports multiple notification channels including email, SMS, and push notifications. The service implements templating for consistent messaging and includes scheduling capabilities for delayed or periodic notifications.

## Build and Deployment

The backend services can be built and deployed using several provided scripts:

- `build-all.sh`: Compiles all services using Maven
- `run-all.sh`: Starts all services locally for development purposes

The root `pom.xml` file defines the parent project configuration, including common dependencies and plugins used across all services. Each service has its own `pom.xml` file that inherits from the parent and adds service-specific dependencies.

## Development Guidelines

When developing or extending the backend services, follow these guidelines:

1. Maintain the microservice architecture principles, ensuring each service has a single responsibility.
2. Use the existing patterns for service-to-service communication.
3. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new functionality.
4. Follow the established security practices, particularly for authentication and authorization.
5. Ensure all API endpoints are documented according to the project standards.
6. Maintain backward compatibility when modifying existing APIs.

## Logging and Monitoring

All services implement centralized logging using Spring Boot's logging capabilities. Logs are stored in the `logs` directory and follow a consistent format across services. For production deployments, consider integrating with external logging and monitoring solutions such as ELK stack or Prometheus/Grafana.

## Database Configuration

Each service that requires persistence (User Service, Payment Service) is configured to use its own database instance to maintain service independence. Database connection properties are specified in each service's `application.properties` file. For development environments, H2 in-memory databases are used by default, while production environments should configure appropriate database instances.

## Security Considerations

The backend implements several security measures including:

- **Hardened JWT-based authentication** at the API Gateway level, with improved exception logging for invalid/expired tokens.
- **Strong Password Policy** enforced during user registration.
- Role-based access control for API endpoints
- Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing
- HTTPS for all external communications
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

When extending the system, ensure that these security principles are maintained and enhanced as needed.
