# PayNext Project Architecture Overview

The **PayNext** project follows a modern microservices-based architecture designed to deliver scalable, efficient, and secure financial transactions. This document provides an in-depth overview of the system's architecture, components, and data flow to help understand the design principles behind PayNext.

## Overview

The PayNext platform aims to provide a seamless and reliable experience for financial transactions. By leveraging a microservices architecture, PayNext offers flexibility, high availability, and scalability. The architecture uses Kubernetes for container orchestration, Helm for package management, and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Microservices Architecture

PayNext employs a microservices-based architecture where different business functions are broken down into self-contained services. Each service has its own database and runs independently, making the architecture resilient and easy to scale. Communication between services is done via REST APIs.

The primary microservices include:

1. **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and user profiles.
2. **Payment Service**: Handles all aspects of financial transactions, such as initiating payments, processing payments, and transaction history.
3. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users for various activities such as payment confirmations or account updates.

Each of these services communicates with the **API Gateway** to route external requests and ensure secure access control.

## Components

### Eureka Server

- **Purpose**: Acts as a service registry for managing microservices within the system.
- **Technology**: Built using **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Registers all the microservices.
    - Ensures that each service can discover other services for communication.
    - Provides resiliency by maintaining service instance information.

### API Gateway

- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point for all external requests to the microservices.
- **Technology**: Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway**.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Manages and routes requests to different microservices.
    - Handles **JWT authentication** for securing access.
    - Implements rate limiting and load balancing.

### User Service

- **Purpose**: Manages user information, including registration, login, and profile.
- **Technology**: Developed with **Spring Boot** and connects to a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Key Features**:
    - User registration and authentication.
    - JWT token generation for securing requests.
    - CRUD operations for user profiles.

### Payment Service

- **Purpose**: Facilitates financial transactions.
- **Technology**: Built using **Spring Boot**, communicates with the **User Service** to validate users, and stores transactions in a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Key Features**:
    - Initiates payments between users.
    - Manages different payment methods.
    - Stores transaction history.

### Notification Service

- **Purpose**: Sends notifications related to different events in the system.
- **Technology**: Developed with **Spring Boot**.
- **Communication**: Integrates with the **User Service** and **Payment Service** to send appropriate notifications.
- **Key Features**:
    - Email and SMS notifications.
    - Real-time alerts for payment-related events.

### Frontend

- **Purpose**: User interface to access the PayNext platform.
- **Technology**: Built with **React.js**.
- **Key Features**:
    - Registration, login, and payment initiation.
    - Dashboard for viewing account details and payment history.
    - Responsive design to ensure usability across devices.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**: A new user registers via the frontend. The request goes through the **API Gateway** and is routed to the **User Service**, which stores the information in the database.

2. **Authentication**: When a user logs in, the **User Service** authenticates the credentials and generates a **JWT token**, which is used for all subsequent requests to secure the communication.

3. **Payment Process**:
    - The user initiates a payment from the frontend, and the request is routed through the **API Gateway**.
    - The **Payment Service** validates the request and processes the payment if the user is authenticated.
    - After processing, the **Notification Service** sends a notification to the user.

4. **Service Discovery**: All services are registered with the **Eureka Server** for discovery. For example, if the **Payment Service** needs to communicate with the **User Service**, it discovers the appropriate instance via Eureka.

## Security

- **JWT Authentication**: The **User Service** generates JWT tokens to ensure secure access to the system. The **API Gateway** verifies the JWT tokens for all incoming requests.
- **HTTPS**: All communication is encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to different resources is managed through roles.

## Deployment

- **Containerization**: All services are containerized using **Docker**.
- **Kubernetes**: Used for orchestration. **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** manages the containerized services in the cloud.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: **Terraform** is used to provision the cloud infrastructure, including **VPCs**, **EKS clusters**, and **S3 buckets**.
- **Helm**: Manages Kubernetes deployments using Helm charts, enabling easy upgrades and rollbacks.
