## Inventories
The inventories are divided into three environments:

- **Development (dev)**: Contains inventory files and variables specific to the development environment.
- **Staging (staging)**: Contains inventory files and variables for the staging environment, used for testing before production.
- **Production (prod)**: Contains inventory files and variables for the production environment.

Each inventory folder includes a `hosts` file that lists the hosts in that environment, and a `group_vars` directory that contains global variables for the hosts.

## Roles
Roles are used to encapsulate the tasks, handlers, templates, and variables required to configure and deploy each service in the PayNext project.

### Common Role
The `common` role contains tasks, handlers, templates, and variables that are common across all services, such as setting up a common environment and installing dependencies.

- **Tasks**: The `main.yml` file in `tasks/` defines the common setup actions.
- **Handlers**: The `main.yml` file in `handlers/` defines handlers for tasks like service restart.
- **Templates**: The `common_config.j2` file contains a template for common configurations.
- **Vars**: The `main.yml` file in `vars/` defines variables shared across all services.

### API Gateway Role
The `api-gateway` role manages the deployment and configuration of the API Gateway service.

- **Tasks**: Defined in `tasks/main.yml`.
- **Handlers**: Handlers for the API Gateway, such as restarting the service.
- **Templates**: The `api_gateway_config.j2` file contains configuration specific to the API Gateway.
- **Vars**: Variables specific to the API Gateway are defined in `vars/main.yml`.

### Eureka Server Role
The `eureka-server` role is responsible for the Eureka server configuration and deployment.

- **Tasks**: The main deployment tasks are defined in `tasks/main.yml`.
- **Handlers**: Handlers such as service notifications.
- **Templates**: The `eureka_server_config.j2` file contains configuration for the Eureka server.
- **Vars**: Variables specific to the Eureka server are defined in `vars/main.yml`.

### Notification, Payment, and User Service Roles
These roles follow a similar structure to the `api-gateway` and `eureka-server` roles, with their own tasks, handlers, templates, and variables for deploying and configuring each service.

## Ansible Configuration
The `ansible.cfg` file contains the Ansible configuration for the PayNext project. This includes inventory paths, logging settings, and SSH options for the deployment.

Example `ansible.cfg`:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory      = ./inventories/dev/hosts
remote_user    = ubuntu
host_key_checking = False
```

## Playbooks
### deploy.yml
The `deploy.yml` playbook is used to deploy all services in the PayNext project. It runs the necessary roles to set up the infrastructure, configure each service, and ensure everything is running correctly.

### rollback.yml
The `rollback.yml` playbook is used to roll back deployments if any issues occur. It reverts services to the previous stable state.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Set Up Inventories**: Update the `hosts` and `group_vars` files in each inventory folder to reflect your environment's servers and settings.
2. **Run Playbook**: Use the following command to deploy:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml
   ```
3. **Rollback**: In case of issues, run the rollback playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback.yml
   ```

## Summary
The Ansible setup for the PayNext project is designed to facilitate easy deployment and configuration of all services. Each role is tailored to a specific microservice, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.
