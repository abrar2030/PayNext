# Kubernetes Manifests for PayNext

## Overview

The k8s directory contains the Kubernetes manifest files that define the deployment configuration for the PayNext fintech payment solution in a Kubernetes environment. These manifests provide a comprehensive, declarative approach to deploying, scaling, and managing the containerized microservices that make up the PayNext application. The configuration files in this directory follow Kubernetes best practices and are structured to support deployment across different environments while maintaining consistency and reliability.

## Directory Structure

The k8s directory is organized into subdirectories that correspond to the different components of the PayNext application. Each subdirectory contains the Kubernetes manifest files specific to that component, including Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and other Kubernetes resources. This organization makes it easy to locate and manage the configuration for each component independently while maintaining a cohesive overall deployment strategy.

The component-specific subdirectories include api-gateway, eureka-server, mobile-frontend, notification-service, payment-service, user-service, and web-frontend. Each contains the necessary manifests to deploy and configure that particular service within the Kubernetes cluster. The secrets.yaml file at the root of the k8s directory contains sensitive configuration data used by multiple components, encrypted using Kubernetes secrets management.

## Deployment Configuration

The Kubernetes manifests define the deployment configuration for each component, specifying details such as container images, resource requirements, environment variables, and volume mounts. The Deployment resources ensure that the specified number of replicas for each component are maintained, with automatic recovery from failures. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configurations are included for components that require dynamic scaling based on load.

Service resources define how each component is exposed within the cluster and, when appropriate, to external users. Internal services use ClusterIP for communication between components, while user-facing components use LoadBalancer or NodePort services to expose endpoints externally. Ingress resources are configured to manage external access to the services, with routing rules based on paths and hostnames.

## Configuration Management

ConfigMap resources are used to manage non-sensitive configuration data, separating configuration from the container images to enable environment-specific settings without rebuilding images. Environment variables and configuration files are injected into containers using ConfigMaps, allowing for consistent container images across environments with environment-specific configurations.

Secret resources manage sensitive data such as API keys, credentials, and certificates. These secrets are encrypted at rest and only decrypted when needed by the pods. Access to secrets is controlled through Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure that only authorized components can access sensitive information.

## Resource Management

The manifests include resource requests and limits for CPU and memory, ensuring that each component has the resources it needs while preventing any single component from consuming excessive resources. These settings are tuned based on the expected load and performance requirements of each component. Quality of Service (QoS) classes are assigned based on these resource specifications, influencing scheduling and eviction decisions by the Kubernetes scheduler.

## Network Policies

Network policies define the allowed communication paths between components, implementing the principle of least privilege at the network level. These policies restrict pod-to-pod communication to only what is necessary for the application to function, enhancing security by reducing the attack surface. Egress policies control outbound traffic from the cluster, ensuring that components only communicate with authorized external services.

## Persistent Storage

For components that require persistent storage, such as databases or file storage services, the manifests include PersistentVolumeClaim resources. These claims request storage from the underlying infrastructure according to the specified storage class, capacity, and access mode. The storage configuration is designed to be portable across different Kubernetes environments while maintaining data durability and performance.

## Health Checks and Monitoring

Liveness and readiness probes are configured for each component to enable Kubernetes to monitor the health of the application and take appropriate action when issues are detected. These probes use HTTP endpoints, TCP sockets, or command execution to determine the health status of containers. Prometheus annotations are included to enable metrics collection for monitoring and alerting.

## Deployment Strategy

The manifests implement rolling update strategies for zero-downtime deployments, with configuration for maximum unavailable and maximum surge to control the pace of updates. Readiness probes ensure that new versions are only considered available when they are truly ready to serve traffic. For components with stateful requirements, StatefulSet resources are used instead of Deployments to maintain stable network identities and persistent storage.

## Environment-Specific Configuration

While the manifests in this directory provide a base configuration, environment-specific overrides can be applied using Kustomize or Helm. The base configuration is designed to work in any environment, with environment-specific settings applied through overlays or value files. This approach ensures consistency across environments while allowing for necessary variations in configuration.

## Usage Guidelines

When working with the Kubernetes manifests, follow these guidelines:

Always use version control for manifest changes, treating infrastructure code with the same rigor as application code. Test manifest changes in lower environments before applying them to production. Use kubectl apply with the --dry-run flag to validate changes before applying them. Monitor the rollout of changes using kubectl rollout status to ensure successful deployment. Be cautious when modifying stateful components, as changes may affect persistent data.

## Extending the Configuration

When extending the Kubernetes configuration to support new features or components, maintain consistency with the existing architecture and follow the established patterns. Create new subdirectories for new components, following the same structure as existing ones. Ensure that new components include appropriate resource limits, health checks, and security configurations. Document new components thoroughly, including their purpose, dependencies, and configuration options.
