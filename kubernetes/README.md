## Introduction

This Helm chart provides a comprehensive, secure, and compliant deployment solution for the PayNext financial application on Kubernetes. It is designed to meet the stringent requirements of financial industry regulations including PCI-DSS, SOX, GDPR, and other relevant standards.

PayNext is a fintech payment solution that requires robust security, high availability, and comprehensive monitoring. This Helm chart implements industry best practices for deploying financial applications in containerized environments.

## Compliance and Security

This Helm chart is designed with the following compliance frameworks in mind:

### PCI-DSS Compliance
- Network segmentation via strict network policies
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular automated backups
- Least privilege access controls

### SOX Compliance
- Audit trails for all system changes
- Segregation of duties via RBAC
- Controlled deployment processes
- Change management controls

### GDPR Compliance
- Data protection by design
- Secure data handling
- Data minimization principles
- Ability to implement right to be forgotten

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Identify: Asset management and access control
- Protect: Secure configurations and data protection
- Detect: Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection
- Respond: Response planning and communications
- Recover: Recovery planning and improvements

## Architecture

The PayNext application consists of the following microservices:

1. **Eureka Server**: Service discovery for microservices
2. **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests with authentication and routing
3. **User Service**: User management and authentication
4. **Payment Service**: Core payment processing functionality
5. **Notification Service**: Handles notifications via email, SMS, etc.
6. **Frontend**: Web interface for the application

The Helm chart deploys these services with appropriate security contexts, resource limits, health checks, and network policies to ensure a secure and reliable operation.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the PayNext application, ensure you have:

1. Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+)
2. Helm (v3.0+)
3. kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
4. Namespace created for the application
5. TLS certificates for secure communication
6. Secrets management solution (optional but recommended)

## Installation

### Adding the Repository

```bash
helm repo add paynext https://charts.paynext.com
helm repo update
```

### Creating the Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace paynext
```

### Installing the Chart

```bash
helm install paynext paynext/paynext -n paynext -f values-prod.yaml
```

## Configuration

The Helm chart is highly configurable through the `values.yaml` file. Below are the key configuration sections:

### Global Configuration

```yaml
global:
  namespace: paynext
  ingressClass: nginx
  compliance:
    pci: true
    gdpr: true
    sox: true
  security:
    networkPolicies: true
    podSecurityPolicies: true
    securityContext:
      enabled: true
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 10001
      fsGroup: 10001
```

### Service-Specific Configuration

Each service can be configured individually:

```yaml
apiGateway:
  image:
    repository: abrar2030/backend-api-gateway
    tag: latest
    pullPolicy: Always
  service:
    port: 8002
    type: ClusterIP
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
```

### Security Configuration

```yaml
secrets:
  create: true
  data:
    jwt_secret: "REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_JWT_SECRET"
    payment_gateway_api_key: "REPLACE_WITH_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
```

### RBAC Configuration

```yaml
rbac:
  create: true
  roles:
    - name: paynext-admin
      rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods", "services", "configmaps", "secrets"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

### Network Policies

```yaml
networkPolicies:
  enabled: true
  defaultDenyIngress: true
  defaultDenyEgress: false
  allowedNamespaces:
    - kube-system
    - monitoring
```

### Monitoring Configuration

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
  grafana:
    enabled: true
```

### Backup Configuration

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"
  retention: 30
```

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, it's recommended to:

1. Create a dedicated `values-prod.yaml` file
2. Set resource limits appropriate for production workloads
3. Enable all security features
4. Configure proper monitoring and alerting
5. Set up regular backups

```bash
helm install paynext paynext/paynext -n paynext -f values-prod.yaml
```

### Staging Deployment

For staging environments:

```bash
helm install paynext-staging paynext/paynext -n paynext-staging -f values-staging.yaml
```

### Development Deployment

For development environments:

```bash
helm install paynext-dev paynext/paynext -n paynext-dev -f values-dev.yaml
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

The chart includes Prometheus for monitoring and can be configured to send alerts to various channels:

### Prometheus Configuration

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from all PayNext services. The configuration can be customized in the `values.yaml` file.

### Grafana Dashboards

Pre-configured Grafana dashboards are included for:
- System metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Application metrics (request rates, error rates, latencies)
- Business metrics (transaction volumes, success rates)

### Alert Rules

Alert rules are defined for:
- High error rates
- Service unavailability
- Resource constraints
- Security events

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backups

The chart includes a CronJob for regular backups of:
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets (encrypted)
- PVCs
- Deployments
- Services
- Ingresses

### Disaster Recovery

In case of a disaster:

1. Create a new cluster if necessary
2. Install the Helm chart
3. Restore the latest backup
4. Verify the application functionality

## Security Best Practices

### Pod Security

- All pods run as non-root users
- Appropriate security contexts are applied
- Resource limits prevent DoS attacks

### Network Security

- Network policies restrict communication between services
- Ingress is secured with TLS
- External communication uses HTTPS

### Secret Management

- Secrets are stored securely in Kubernetes
- Sensitive values are not stored in plain text
- Consider using external secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault

### Access Control

- RBAC is implemented for all components
- Service accounts have minimal permissions
- Regular access reviews are recommended

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Pod Startup Failures

Check for resource constraints:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n paynext
```

#### Network Connectivity Issues

Verify network policies:
```bash
kubectl get networkpolicies -n paynext
```

#### Permission Issues

Check RBAC configuration:
```bash
kubectl auth can-i --as=system:serviceaccount:paynext:paynext-admin-sa get pods -n paynext
```

### Logs

Access logs for troubleshooting:
```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/api-gateway -n paynext
```

## Maintenance

### Upgrading

To upgrade the application:
```bash
helm upgrade paynext paynext/paynext -n paynext -f values-prod.yaml
```

### Scaling

To scale a service:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment api-gateway --replicas=3 -n paynext
```

Or update the `values.yaml` file and upgrade the release.

### Rollback

To rollback to a previous release:
```bash
helm rollback paynext 1 -n paynext
```
